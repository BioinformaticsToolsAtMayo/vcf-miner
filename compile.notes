The project is set up to not run the tests, so that debugging and adding features is a lot faster in intellij, but to really test, you need to run this at the command line:

Run the entire compile:
mvn clean install

Run only the unit tests (no functional tests)
mvn clean package

Skip tests:
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Deploy directory:
/data2/bsi/RandD/test/variant_miner/installer/<version>
